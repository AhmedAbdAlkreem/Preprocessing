# Preprocessing
All you need to be dataset ready to work in model without any Noise.

In code include:
1) How to handle dataset before work in model.
2) Deal with numerical data.
3) Deal with categorical dataset.
4) Encoding dataset that type binary and order data.
5) One hot encoding work in nominal data.
6) how to scaling dataset.
7) In the end data read to work on it without noise.
